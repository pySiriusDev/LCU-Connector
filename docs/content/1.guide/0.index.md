# Introduction
This library serves to make the connection with the League Client API in a simple way, although there are others, such as [lcu-driver](https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver) (which by the way is very good), but with lcu-driver, for example, I couldn't work and structure my code the way I wanted it to, so I decided to make my own wrapper.

You can see all available links for League Client through [LCU Explorer](https://github.com/HextechDocs/lcu-explorer).
